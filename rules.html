    <h1>How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <p>
        Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is easy to learn but offers surprising strategic depth. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. One player plays as "X" and the other as "O". Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie, which is sometimes called a "cat's game".
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The main objective in Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to form a continuous line of three of your own marks. This line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A secondary objective, if you cannot win, is to block your opponent from getting three of their marks in a row, forcing the game into a draw. Understanding both offensive and defensive play is key to becoming a skilled player.
    </p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        1. The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The first player, traditionally "X", places their mark in any of the nine squares.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The second player, "O", then places their mark in any of the remaining empty squares.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. The players continue to alternate turns, placing their marks in unoccupied squares, until one player achieves a winning combination or the grid is completely filled.
    </p>
    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>
        A player wins by successfully placing three of their marks in a row. There are eight possible winning combinations:
    </p>
    <p>
        - Three in a row horizontally (top, middle, or bottom row).
    </p>
    <p>
        - Three in a row vertically (left, middle, or right column).
    </p>
    <p>
        - Three in a row diagonally (from top-left to bottom-right, or from top-right to bottom-left).
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a player achieves one of these combinations, the game immediately ends, and that player is declared the winner.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        For the first player ("X"): The best opening move is to take the center square. This gives you the most opportunities to create a three-in-a-row. If the center is not available, a corner square is the next best choice. Placing your first mark on an edge (a non-corner, non-center square) is the weakest opening.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the second player ("O"): If the first player takes the center, you should respond by taking a corner. If the first player takes a corner, you should take the center. If the first player takes an edge, you can often force a win by taking the center and then responding to their subsequent moves.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key to strategy is looking ahead. Before making a move, consider if it will allow your opponent to win on their next turn. The best move is one that either creates a winning opportunity for you or blocks a winning opportunity for your opponent. A perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where both players play optimally, will always result in a draw. The challenge lies in capitalizing on your opponent's mistakes.
