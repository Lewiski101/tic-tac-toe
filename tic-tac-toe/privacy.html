    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to our Tic-Tac-Toe game. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how we handle information in relation to our game. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our players. This game is designed to be a simple, enjoyable experience that does not require the collection of personal data. This policy will explain what information we do not collect, why we do not collect it, and how this approach ensures your privacy is respected while you play. Our goal is to be transparent about our data practices, even when those practices are intentionally minimal.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our Tic-Tac-Toe game is a standalone, client-side application that runs entirely within your web browser. As such, we do not collect, store, or have access to any personally identifiable information (PII) from our players. This includes, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
        - Your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Your IP address or device identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Information about your location.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Any data related to your gameplay, such as win/loss records, high scores, or usage patterns. All game state information is stored locally on your device and is reset when you close the game or restart it.
    </p>
    <p>
        - We do not use cookies or any other tracking technologies to monitor your activity on our site or across other sites.
    </p>
    <h2>Why We Do Not Collect Information</h2>
    <p>
        The philosophy behind our Tic-Tac-Toe game is to provide a pure and simple gaming experience. We believe that you should be able to enjoy a quick game without having to worry about your personal data being collected, used, or shared. The nature of this game does not require any personal information to function. There are no user accounts, no leaderboards, and no online multiplayer features that would necessitate data collection. By not collecting data, we eliminate the risk of data breaches and ensure that your privacy is protected by design.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        This game does not integrate with any third-party services, such as analytics companies, advertisers, or social media platforms. Therefore, no data is shared with any third parties. The game is self-contained and does not make any external network requests, other than to load the initial game files. This ensures that your activity remains private and is not tracked by external entities.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        While we do not collect any personal data, we are still committed to ensuring a secure experience. The game is delivered to you over a secure connection, and the code is designed to be safe and not to harm your device. Since all game data is handled locally on your computer, you are in complete control of it. There is no central server storing your information that could be a target for malicious attacks.
    </p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This game is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any of our users, we are in full compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other regulations designed to protect the privacy of younger internet users.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. Since we do not collect your contact information, we are unable to notify you directly of any changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy. Your continued use of the game after any changes to this policy will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information.
