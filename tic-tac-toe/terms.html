    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
        By accessing and playing our Tic-Tac-Toe game, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. These terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the game. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the game. Your access to and use of the game is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>2. The Game</h2>
    <p>
        Our Tic-Tac-Toe game is provided to you "as is" for your personal, non-commercial entertainment. The game is a simple, browser-based application and does not require any registration or the creation of a user account. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the game for your own personal entertainment purposes.
    </p>
    <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>
        You agree to use the game only for its intended purpose and in a manner that is lawful and does not infringe on the rights of, restrict, or inhibit anyone else's use and enjoyment of the game. Prohibited behavior includes harassing or causing distress or inconvenience to any other person, transmitting obscene or offensive content, or disrupting the normal flow of dialogue within the game. As this is a single-player (against another local player) game, we expect you to play fairly and enjoy the experience.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        The game and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the game's creators. This includes all of the code, graphics, and text associated with the game. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our game, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of the software.
    </p>
    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>
        The game is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        In no event shall we or our suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on our website, even if we or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
    </p>
    <h2>7. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our game after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the game.
    </p>
    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the land, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
